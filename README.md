Hello, I'm Jenson Tabler (@IJtabler) 
I am currently a CS Student at Ohio State.
Currently, I am working on a personal project for the apple watch that will control my wheelchair. It is pushed by small detachable motor, so a small detachable device i.e. a watch is needed to control it, in this case via bluetooth. (tap twice on the wheelchair rims to start, once to set speed, and twice again to stop or by a button in the watch.) 
You can reach me at ijtabler@gmail.com, tabler.36@osu.edu, or my number 567-356-6923.
